  "description": "The playing board is a grid. Each cell of the grid is filled with a number (except one cell which is blank). The objective of the game is to arrange the numbers in ascending order with the blank cell at the lower right. A numbered tile can only move if it is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the blank cell. Each movement of a tile counts as a single move.",
